## Challenges 
Through this project I started over about 3 or 4 times as I continued to hit the same wall and tried to give myself new baselines to work with before hitting the wall.

The wall in question was adding the contents of the individual arrays into one master array. My tutor assisted me by reintroducing .push and gave me the strategy of creating a base blank array. With this information it became pretty logical as I already had the vision of using the for loop on my new array but simply couldnt figure out how to compile them into 1 based on the selected prompts. 

Despite the frustration associated I learned a ton from this and got a lot of practice in. In the end, once it was complete, I loved this project!
